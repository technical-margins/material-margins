# Technical Margins

Welcome to **Technical Margins**, a personal blog and experimentation space focused on static site generators, documentation, and technical writing. This repository is built with **MkDocs** and the **Material theme** and serves as a platform to explore blogging, multilingual support, and the capabilities of GitHub for personal projects.

## Experimental setup across multiple repositories

This repository is part of a broader experimentation initiative where each repository focuses on a different static site generator (SSG).

By exploring various SSGs, I aim to gain a well-rounded understanding of different platforms, their configurations, and their suitability for technical documentation and blogging projects. **Technical Margins** is dedicated to MkDocs, but other repositories under the same umbrella will follow similar experimentation processes for comparison.

## License

This repository is for personal experimentation and learning. It is not intended for public use or distribution, so no license is applied.
