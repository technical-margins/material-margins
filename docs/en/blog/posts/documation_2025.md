# Chronicle of a Foretold Mutation: Reflections from Documation 2025

I crossed the threshold of Documation 2025 with that peculiar blend of curiosity and apprehension that now defines our relationship with innovation. Notebook in hand, pen poised to capture the essence of this annual gathering of information management professionals, I was seeking revelations. Moments of insight. That spark that transforms an ordinary workday into a pivotal moment...

My first impression from the opening conference was mixed. It wasn't without merit, but felt like echoes of all-too-familiar ideas that have been circulating through every media channel for the past two years. On one side stand the evangelists of adaptation at all costs: *"AGI is coming, like it or not – adapt or vanish."* On the other, the guardians of human-centred values, advocating for more regulation and caution.

And there I sat, between these positions, shifting in my chair, searching for my place in this upheaval.

## The Conformity of Innovation

Moving from workshop to workshop, I was struck by an almost comical uniformity in what was being presented. Everywhere, the same recipe. Innovation had somehow become an exercise in conformity. Nobody wanting to miss out, everyone plunging into RAG, *retrieval-augmented generation*, to catch the high-speed ferry of AI and stay afloat. In such a context, how could one stand out?

This collective frenzy – a profession swimming frantically in unison – raises a fundamental question: don't we, as information professionals, have a duty to question as much as we adopt?

One moment particularly struck me. A speaker was explaining the current limitations of AI models for a specific use case. From the row behind, a whisper rose: *"For now, yes, but for how long?"* This phrase, uttered with mystical reverence, captures our ambivalent relationship with technology: a blend of resignation, hope and exhilaration – the certainty of a future where every limitation will be overcome.

## The Unspoken Question

Day two brought revelations, though not those I'd expected. During a panel celebrating the historical adaptability of documentation departments, a voice rose from the audience – a moving testimony that silenced the room: the story of mass layoffs in a documentation team at a major French company, these professionals having been deemed *"useful but not necessary"* after external consultants automated much of their work.

This moment crystallised fears. The silence in the room was deafening, as if everyone were thinking: *"Will I be next?"* I recalled what I'd written months ago: *"AI doesn't make my days less busy; it transforms them, enriches them, extends them too."* But how far does this transformation go? Where is the line between enrichment and replacement?

The official response came quickly: *"Learn continuously, master these tools so you don't fall behind."* An injunction that sounds like a verdict – condemned to run endlessly, investing our time and energy with no guarantee of proportional recognition. Betterment for survival more than for prosperity.

## The Prompter's Paradox

This now unsubtle transformation of our profession concerns me. In one of the workshops, I heard a question that has haunted me since: *"Aren't writers becoming merely prompt writers?"*

This formulation, both playful and unsettling, perfectly expresses our metamorphosis. We who were content producers have indeed become LLM orchestrators. From now on, our value lies in formulating the right questions and instructions for AI to produce the desired content.

> The writer as commissioner and editor of automatically generated content.
>
> Is this a promotion or a relegation?

I oscillate between these interpretations, as if our professional identity had entered a quantum state. I remember the excitement I felt writing my first script with ChatGPT. But today, faced with constant acceleration, this seems less liberating.

## The Ambassador at the Crossroads of Contradiction

The irony of the situation isn't lost on me. As a self-proclaimed GenAI ambassador who once ventured enthusiastically into this territory, I now navigate a paradox. This conference has amplified my uncertainties, and they drive me to dive even deeper into AI – as if understanding might somehow resolve the tension between opportunity and obsolescence.

This position as an ambassador makes questioning even more delicate. How does one express concerns without appearing inconsistent? I remain convinced of these technologies' potential. But this conviction now coexists with a new vigilance. Perhaps this is my new mission: not just to show what's possible, but also to question what's desirable.

## The Solitude of Adaptation

Between sessions, participants exchange reflections. Many share this feeling of solitude in the face of demands to adapt. *"I spend my evenings training, following tutorials, experimenting with these new tools,"* confides an older documentarian. *"Yet I feel like I'm chasing a train that keeps going faster and faster."*

What strikes me is how this race for adaptation seems to rest on individual shoulders. Organisations demand relevance, but across the sector, how many will truly invest in our transformation?

I catch myself pondering an uncomfortable question: is any recognition even to be expected, since constant adaptation is simply becoming the new standard? This might be the paradox of our era – having to keep evolving to maintain our position, without this permanent effort being acknowledged.

Deep down, we all have concerns about the impact of AI on working conditions. I too worry that AI will widen the gap, already noticeable in many ecosystems, between those who possess technological capital and those who must fight to keep their jobs. The classic refrain of employees racing for employability amid the corporate chase for existence and profitability.

## A Metamorphosis Between Myths and Realities

In this climate of adaptation emerge mystical new job titles: *"AI orchestrators," "prompt engineers"*... As if we're inventing vocabulary to reassure ourselves and give meaning to our forced transformation. Are these truly new professions, or simply old roles in futuristic fancy dress? A genuine metamorphosis, or a rebranding exercise?

In one presentation, I watched a system transform emails with attachments into structured, classified, summarised data in seconds, completely without human input. I felt both technical fascination and existential vertigo. Tasks that once occupied days, reduced to moments by the algorithm. Those new jobs must be real.

I recall writing about [hobbies](eloge_du_plateau.md), that we must preserve *"spaces in our lives where the constant pursuit of improvement has no place."* But if we have to catch up all the time, is there any time left for sanctuaries that escape the optimisation imperative?

## A Transformation Without Instructions

What's lacking in this technological ferment is a human manual for transformation. We know how to operate these tools, but no one seems to know how to operate our societies, teams, and lives with them.

I searched among all these conferences for deep reflection on how this transition could be negotiated collectively. Instead of societal discussion, I found individual injunctions: *adapt, train, transform yourself*, as if responsibility for this historical mutation rested on isolated workers alone.

I think of that instruction-less air fryer I mentioned in [a previous post](documentation_invisible.md). Ironically, we face technologies that will help produce documentation, but lack instruction manuals for ourselves – not technical ones, but human ones.

## Beyond Adaptation, Invention

Leaving Documation 2025, I carried more questions than answers. Perhaps that's the sign of a truly enriching experience.

In the end, beneath the technological veneer, the fundamental questions remain: what gives value and meaning to our work? How does our profession contribute to the common good? What place do we want humans to have in our organisations?

Rather than simply "adapting" to a technological future presented as inevitable, maybe we should aspire to invent it, to shape it according to our values, aspirations, and vision of what human work should be in the AI age.

Because if there's one thing AI can never do for us, it's decide what kind of world we want to build with it.
