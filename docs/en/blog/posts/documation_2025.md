# Chronicle of a Foretold Mutation: Reflections from Documation 2025

I crossed the threshold of Documation 2025 with that peculiar blend of curiosity and apprehension that now defines our relationship with innovation. Notebook in hand, pen poised to capture the essence of this annual gathering of documentation and information management professionals, I was seeking revelations. Moments of insight. That spark that transforms an ordinary workday into a pivotal moment...

My first impression from the opening conference was mixed. It wasn't without merit, but felt like echoes of all-too-familiar ideas that have been circulating through all media channels for the past two years, like a scratched record in our technological modernity. On one side stand the evangelists of adaptation at all costs: *"AGI is coming, like it or not – adapt or vanish."* On the other, the guardians of human-centred values, advocating for more regulation, reflection, and caution.

And there I sat, between these positions, shifting in my chair, searching for my place in this upheaval. This strangely familiar sensation reminded me of [that technical translation project](ai_advent.md) I approached with such scepticism two years ago – before AI became my unexpected collaborator.

## The Conformity of Innovation

Moving from workshop to workshop, I was struck by an almost comical uniformity in what was being presented. Everywhere, the same recipe: RAG systems integrated into more-or-less sophisticated workflows. Innovation had paradoxically become an exercise in conformity. Nobody wanting to miss out, everyone plunging into AI to catch the *hypermodernity* train. In such a context, what would be the proper way to stand out?

We're like fish swimming frantically in the same direction, not knowing whether we're fleeing a predator or chasing a mirage. This collective frenzy troubles me – don't we have a duty, as information professionals, to question as much as we adopt?

One moment particularly struck me. A speaker was explaining the current limitations of AI models for specific use cases. From the row behind, a whisper rose: *"For now, but for how long?"* This phrase, uttered with almost mystical reverence, perfectly captures our ambivalent relationship with technology: a blend of resignation, hope and exhilaration – the certainty of a future where every limitation will be overcome.

## The Unspoken Question

Day two brought revelations, though not those I'd expected. During a panel celebrating the historical adaptability of documentation departments, a voice rose from the audience – a moving testimony that silenced the room: the story of mass layoffs in a documentation team at a major French company, these professionals having been deemed *"useful but not necessary"* after external consultants automated much of their work.

This moment crystallised fears. The silence in the room was deafening, as if everyone were thinking: *"Will I be next?"* I recalled what I'd written months ago: *"AI doesn't make my days less busy; it transforms them, enriches them, extends them too."* But how far does this transformation go? Where is the line between enrichment and replacement?

The official response came quickly: *"Learn continuously, master these tools so you don't fall behind."* An injunction that sounds like a verdict – condemned to run endlessly, investing our time and mental energy with no guarantee of proportional recognition. Adaptation as survival, not improvement as flourishing.

## The Prompter's Paradox

This increasingly unsubtle transformation of our profession concerns me. In one of the workshops, I heard a question that has haunted me since: *"Aren't writers becoming merely prompt writers?"*

This formulation, both playful and unsettling, perfectly expresses our professional metamorphosis. We who were content producers have indeed become LLM orchestrators. Our value no longer lies in generating information directly, but in formulating the right questions and instructions for AI to produce the desired content.

The writer as commissioner and editor of automatically generated content. Is this a promotion or a relegation? I oscillate between these interpretations, as if our professional identity had entered a quantum state of uncertainty. I remember the excitement I felt writing my first script with ChatGPT's help, transforming what seemed like a mountain into a dune blown by the winds. But today, faced with constant acceleration, this professional metamorphosis seems less liberating.

## The Solitude of Adaptation

Between sessions, participants exchange reflections. Many share this concern, this feeling of solitude in the face of demands to adapt. *"I spend my evenings training, following tutorials, experimenting with these new tools,"* confides an older documentarian. *"Yet I feel like I'm chasing a train that keeps going faster and faster."*

What strikes me is how this race for adaptation seems to rest entirely on individual shoulders. Organisations demand relevance, but how many will truly invest in our transformation? How many will recognise upskilling with proportional compensation?

Deep down, we all have concerns about the impact of AI on working conditions. If anything, my fears are intensified. I worry it will further widen the gap between those who possess technological capital and those fighting simply to keep their jobs – employees racing for employability while companies chase existence and profitability.

When I think about documentation that I recently defended as *"an invisible thread"* weaving connections between product and users, I wonder: is this thread changing in nature, or simply changing hands?

## A Metamorphosis Between Myths and Realities

Amid pressure to adapt emerge almost mystical new job titles: *"AI orchestrators,"* *"ethical guardians,"* *"prompt engineers"*... As if we're inventing vocabulary to reassure ourselves, to give meaning to our forced transformation.

Are these truly new professions, or simply old roles in futuristic fancy dress? A genuine metamorphosis, or a rebranding exercise?

In one presentation, I watched a system transform emails with attachments into structured, classified, summarised data in seconds – completely without human input. I felt both technical fascination and existential vertigo. Tasks that once occupied days, reduced to moments by an impassive algorithm.

I recall writing about [hobbies](eloge_du_plateau.md), that we must preserve *"spaces in our lives where the constant pursuit of improvement has no place."* But is there any time left for any sanctuary that escapes the optimisation imperative? How do we maintain *"plateaus"* when everything pushes toward perpetual ascent?

## A Transformation Without Instructions

What's sorely lacking in this technological ferment is a human manual for transformation. We know how to operate these tools, but no one seems to know how to operate our societies, teams, and lives with them.

I searched vainly among all these conferences for deep reflection on how this transition could be negotiated collectively. Instead of societal discussion, I found individual injunctions: *adapt, train, transform yourself* – as if responsibility for this historical mutation rested solely on isolated workers.

I think of that instruction-less air fryer I mentioned in [a previous post](documentation_invisible.md). Ironically, we face technologies that will help produce documentation, but lack instruction manuals for ourselves – not technical ones, but human ones.

## Beyond Adaptation, Invention

Leaving Documation 2025, I carried more questions than answers. Perhaps that's the sign of a truly enriching experience.

In the end, beneath the technological veneer, the fundamental questions remain: what gives value and meaning to our work? How does our profession contribute to the common good? What place do we want humans to have in our organisations?

Rather than simply "adapting" to a technological future presented as inevitable, maybe we should aspire to invent it, to shape it according to our values, aspirations, and vision of what human work should be in the AI age.

Because if there's one thing AI can never do for us, it's decide what kind of world we want to build with it.
