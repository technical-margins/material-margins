# Musical Interlude: In Praise of the Plateau

## Music Away from the Spotlight ðŸŽ¸

*"You've been playing guitar for ages; you must be a virtuoso by now! Play us something?"* How many times have I heard these words, laden with expectations? In a society that's hungry for performance, music seems bound by a double standard: technical excellence and spectacle. In French, "performance" resonates with reaching a high standard, whereas in English, it gravitates towards the stage and the show. And here I am, caught between these two interpretations â€“ perhaps fittingly, as it seems we expect musicians, even amateurs, to be flawlessly skilled and always ready to perform.

But isn't there another way to live through music, a more intimate, freer way?

## The Double Expectation of Performance

Imagine applying this same logic of performance to other passions. Would we say to a friend who devours books, *"You've been reading for so long; you must have written a novel by now?"* Or to someone who loves drawing, *"With all that time spent, when's your exhibition opening?"* True, these might not seem so strange, and could well be said as banter. But let's try with a bit more conviction: *"You've been playing on the PS4 for years, so you're ready for e-sports competitions, right?"*

When it comes to music, this dual pressure â€“ both to achieve and to entertain â€“ seems inescapable. It seeps in, turning what should be a free space into yet another kind of "work", an extension of the continuous improvement efforts we usually reserve for our professional lives. While our days are already shaped around the pursuit of "better and better", shouldn't our hobbies remain sanctuaries, free from this relentless pressure to excel?

## The Freedom of the Plateau

What if we shifted perspective?

In learning, we often speak of the "plateau" as a phase where, despite regular practice, progress appears to stagnate. "Push past the plateau!" enjoin the training gurus on YouTube, whether about learning languages or music. But instead of seeing the plateau as an obstacle, why not think of it as a place to inhabit?

Picture vast plains: elevated yet calm, gently undulating at most, inviting contemplation rather than endless climbing. The musical plateau could become that space where we exist without pressure, without striving ever higher. Simply being there, exploring, with no goal beyond the moment itself. Isn't that liberating?

## A Living Space for Exploration

On the plateau, playing becomes a meditative experience. Rather than aiming for perfection, you could improvise over a backing track, letting your fingers wander, enjoying the notes that just feel right â€“ or even not quite right, but so what? Here, a misplaced note is neither good nor bad; it simply fades into the moment, free of judgement. It's no longer work, but an intimate encounter with the instrument, each note alive in the present.

Similarly, reading tabs can become an exploration without expectation. No need to memorise every part; you can savour each chord, each melody, simply for the pleasure of recreating it, even roughly. No perfection required, just the pure joy of the experience.

## A Private Refuge

Practising "on the plateau" becomes a true refuge â€“ not just from performance pressure, but from the stress and demands of daily life. It's a space to simply be, with no need to prove, measure one's worth, or show progression. Music becomes a way to recharge, a necessary counterpoint to activities focused on results.

## A Quiet Act of Resistance

Taking this "plateau" approach to music becomes a form of resistance against society's push to turn every activity into an optimised performance. It's a way of saying that it is possible â€“ and necessary â€“ to keep spaces in our lives where the constant pursuit of improvement has no place.

By shielding our hobbies from this pressure, we allow our efforts to be spent where they're truly needed. Isn't that a form of wisdom? Let's reclaim these plateaux, sanctuaries where only the flavour of the moment matters, where exploration outweighs mastery, and where solitude becomes a creative force. In a world entranced by progress and performance, choosing the plateau becomes an act of freedom.

What if we dared to see our hobbies differently?
