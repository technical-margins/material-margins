# AI at Work: a Revolution in the Mundane

It's funny how the biggest transformations often begin with a simple *"could you just...?"*. On an otherwise ordinary morning, that seemingly innocuous phrase completely reshaped my approach to work – and even made me rethink my career as a technical writer.

## Lost in Translation

Early 2023. I'm working on a task involving multilingual content standardisation within a technical project. The idea is to *"just"* review what hasn't been translated and harmonise the rest. At first glance, it seems straightforward. I'm not supposed to overhaul everything, just adjust, align, and complete. A minor task, no harder than rearranging a few books on a shelf.

The reality? A raw file with no context. A patchwork where languages mingle like characters in an experimental novel – occasionally coherent, often inconsistent, and sometimes outright surreal.

Doubt creeps in. *Why me?* My dual role as a technical writer and linguist makes me the logical choice. And there's precedent – an internship where I meticulously dissected technical translations, armed with patience and precision. But this time is different. No specific training, no domain expertise, just a mountain of text as welcoming as random error messages.

For the first few days, I stick to the classic approach: methodically, line by line, glossary in hand. But without context, it feels like solving an equation with multiple variables. Is this the right term? Will this translation create inconsistencies elsewhere? This mass of text challenges both my patience and practicality. It's not writing, barely translation – just repetitive, tedious labour. And I catch myself thinking: *A robot could do this just as well.*

## A Surprising Ally

The turning point came during an ordinary conversation when someone casually, yet seriously, suggested: *"Why not ask ChatGPT to translate it for you?"* I was sceptical. *What?* The latest chatbot fad? To me, it was a gimmick, a fun tool, but surely not suitable for this task. Still, I had nothing to lose.

With due approval, I began with simple tests, asking the AI to translate a few lines. The results? Mixed. Some phrases were spot-on, others completely off base. As for harmonisation, the chatbot naturally didn't grasp what to keep or rephrase. Clearly, it wasn't the ideal assistant I'd hoped for. Yet, something struck me: it wasn't perfect, but it was a starting point. And an idea started to take root.

ChatGPT wouldn't be my miracle translator, but why not use it to automate the most boring steps? What I lacked was an algorithm – and the means to apply it. Then, suddenly, I found myself typing: *"Could you code that for me?"*

I knew exactly what I needed: a script to scan the file and handle repetitive tasks more efficiently. The fact that my coding experience was more than limited didn't matter – I could see the solution clearly in my mind.

ChatGPT's first attempts were promising but flawed. Between technical errors and concepts I needed to grasp, I spent my weekends diving into forums, learning programming basics, and refining my prompts. Each failure taught me something new, and gradually, like a photo developing in a darkroom, the script took shape. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it did exactly what I needed.

## Efficiency Unlocked

*And that's how the magic happened.* A mountain shrinks to the size of a manageable dune. My script – born from this unexpected collaboration with AI – transforms days of repetitive labour into a task that runs in hours. I find myself with time again, and with it, a revelation: *if this works for translations, what else can it do?*

Experimentation became second nature. AI evolved from being a simple translation tool into an instrument for amplifying what I can do. Every new use sparks ideas for others.

The real change isn't in the newfound efficiency – it's in knowing I pushed my boundaries. Programming once felt like foreign territory, something only others did. Now I'm devising automation solutions and imagining more efficient workflows. It feels as though I've opened a window into an uncharted dimension.

## New Horizons

This experience taught me something valuable about working with language models like GPT: it's not about delegating but about dialogue. You have to ask the right questions, interpret the answers, refine the outputs. It's a back-and-forth process that balances clarity with experimentation. The relationship evolves constantly. Every day brings a new use case to explore.

As a technical writer, my job hasn't become easier – it's shifted. Automating the repetitive tasks has cleared space for more complex challenges. That's rewarding, but not always straightforward.

Of course, doubts linger. *What happens when the tools become better than good?* When AI models grow more sophisticated, will there still be a need for technical writers? My understanding of the product and its users offers protection, yet wisps of uncertainty persist.

That's the paradox of generative AI. It raises the bar. Every efficiency gain comes with new demands. The more we can do with AI, the more is expected of us.

Indeed, GenAI requires that we keep moving, learning, and adapting. The saying goes: *"AI won't take your job, but someone who knows how to use it will..."* It might as well be: *"Someone who can use AI better than you will..."* That thought, both daunting and exhilarating, has become a source of motivation.

Our profession is reinventing itself. In this shifting landscape, adaptability is as critical as technical expertise. And maybe that's the real revolution: not the tools we use, but the way they challenge us to stay curious, adaptive, and open to change.

So, when someone asks *"could you just...?"* next time, I'll be curious – wondering not just what's being asked of me, but what I might learn in the process.
