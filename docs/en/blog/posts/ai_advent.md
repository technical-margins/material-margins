# AI at work: a revolution in the mundane

It's funny how the biggest transformations often begin with a simple *"could you just...?"*. On an otherwise ordinary morning, that seemingly innocuous phrase completely reshaped my approach to work – and even made me rethink my career as a technical writer.

## Diving into chaos

Early 2023. I'm handed the task of harmonising the translations of a professional software tool. The idea is to *“just”* review what hasn't been translated and standardise the rest. At first glance, it seems straightforward. I'm not expected to overhaul everything, just adjust, complete, and align the content. A minor task, no harder than rearranging a few books on a shelf.

The reality? A raw, unformatted file with no context. A linguistic patchwork where French and English mingle like characters in an experimental novel – occasionally coherent, often inconsistent, and sometimes outright surreal. Some sections resemble the output of an early-2000s machine translator. Even words in my native language baffle me.

Doubt creeps in. *Why me?* My dual role as a technical writer and linguist makes me the logical choice. And there's precedent – that internship where I meticulously dissected technical translations, armed with patience and precision. But this time is different. No specific training, no domain expertise, just a mountain of text as welcoming as an unexpected error message. Not to mention that, naturally, the ambitious deadline elegantly overlaps with my regular workload.

For the first few days, I stick to the classic approach: methodically, line by line, glossary in hand. But without context, each field feels like solving an equation with multiple variables. Is this the right term? Will this translation create inconsistencies elsewhere in the software? This mass of text challenges both my patience and practicality. It's not technical writing, barely translation – just repetitive, tedious, frustrating labour. And I catch myself thinking: *A robot could do this just as well.*

## An unexpected suggestion

Turning points sometimes come from the most casual conversations. As I explain my struggles to the manager who's given me this task, his reply catches me off guard: *"Why not ask ChatGPT to translate it for you?"* A suggestion tossed out almost offhandedly, yet entirely serious. He genuinely sees this chatbot everyone is talking about as a potential solution.

Now I admit that I was sceptical. *What?* The latest chatbot fad? To me, it was a gimmick, a fun tool, but surely not suitable for professional work. Still, I had nothing to lose. So I decided to give it a try.

I began with simple tests, asking it to translate a few fields. The results? Mixed. Some phrases were spot-on, others entirely off base. And as for harmonisation, the chatbot naturally didn't grasp what to keep or rephrase. Clearly, it wasn't the ideal assistant I'd hoped for. Yet, something struck me: it wasn't perfect, but it was a starting point. And an idea started to take root.

ChatGPT wouldn't be my miracle translator, but why not use it to automate the most laborious steps? Identifying poorly translated fields, flagging those to standardise... What I lacked was an algorithm – and the means to apply it. Then, suddenly, I found myself typing: *"Could you code that for me?"*

## An improvised partnership

I phrased my request precisely. I knew exactly what I needed: a script capable of identifying French fields, comparing them to an existing glossary, and proposing translations via an API like DeepL. The fact I didn't know how to code wasn't a dealbreaker – my goal was clear.

ChatGPT's initial attempts were promising but flawed. Between technical errors and concepts I needed to grasp, I spent my weekends diving into forums, learning programming basics, and refining my prompts. But gradually, like a photo developing in a darkroom, the script took shape. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it did exactly what I needed.

## A turning point in my routine

And suddenly, the magic happens. What had felt like a mountain of work shrinks to the size of a manageable dune. My script – born from this unexpected collaboration with AI – transforms weeks of repetitive labour into a task that runs in hours. I find myself with time again, and with it, a revelation: if this works for translations, why not other aspects of my work?

Experimentation became second nature. AI evolved from being a simple translation assistant to something more versatile: now it reformulates complex passages, structures ideas, and explores technical concepts. It's no longer just a tool for saving time; it's a tool for amplifying what I can do. Every new use sparks ideas for others.

But the real change isn't in the newfound efficiency – it's in the feeling of having pushed my own boundaries. Programming once felt like foreign territory, something other people did. Now I'm devising automation solutions and imagining workflows that are more efficient, more creative. It feels like I've unlocked a new dimension of my job.

## New horizons for my profession

This experience taught me something essential about working with AI: it's not about delegating but about dialogue. You have to ask the right questions, interpret the answers, refine the outputs. It's a back-and-forth process that balances clarity with experimentation.

The relationship evolves constantly. Every day, there's something new to discover, another use case to explore. My job hasn't become easier – it's transformed. The repetitive tasks are gone, leaving space for more creative, complex challenges. Where I once spent hours harmonising translations, I now focus on improving documentation as a whole: coherence, user experience, and global consistency.

Of course, doubts linger. Every now and then, I'm reminded that I'm working with a machine. What if this tool becomes too good? What if someone with more technical expertise automates everything I do? For now, the complexity and specificity of our documentation shield me. But I know this won't last forever.

And that's the paradox. AI frees us from repetitive tasks, but it doesn't make the work easier. It raises expectations and expands horizons. The more I can do with AI, the more is expected of me. It doesn't lighten my workload; it transforms, enriches, and extends it.

AI is an incredible tool, but it requires that we keep moving, learning, and adapting. As the saying goes: *“AI won't take your job, but someone who knows how to use it will...”* Or is it: *“Someone who can use AI better than you.”*? That thought, both daunting and exhilarating, has become a source of motivation.

Because ultimately, AI remains a tool that depends on our ability to guide it, feed it, and make sense of what it produces. It amplifies our skills but doesn't replace our judgement, our understanding of context, or our capacity to see beyond raw data.

My profession is evolving, transforming, and gaining new dimensions. In this shifting landscape, adaptability is as critical as technical expertise. And maybe the next time I'm handed a project that seems simple, I'll know it's really an opportunity for innovation.
