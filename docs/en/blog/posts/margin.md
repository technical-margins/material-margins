# Technical Margins: Exploring Forgotten Spaces

Why *Technical Margins*? Why not, one might say. This title felt natural. It's there, in the margin, that life slips in. When I think back to my school years, even through university, I see my notebooks, my loose sheets, marked with small sketches, scrawled along the edges, just outside the main content. Far from empty, these margins were lively spaces, uncultivated patches where ideas roamed freely, thoughts that spilled out, uninvited, from the official structure of lessons. For me, doodling in the margins was a way of listening, of musing – a way to let my thoughts wander and explore.

This connection between the margin and creative freedom follows me now in my work as a technical writer. Documentation, a bit like those sketches of yore, often lives in the margin of the product. It's there when needed, off centre stage, sitting quietly in the background, ready to enrich the user experience. And although labelled as "technical", it retains within it a small margin of freedom, a secret corner where, despite everything, a hint of creativity sneaks in.

## The Margin as a Creative Space: Beyond Boundaries

But why this fondness for the margins, this attraction to what lies neither here nor there? Perhaps it's because, in the margin, one can sidestep the constraints of the central framework. What slips into these spaces is less formal, more free. And this isn't limited to the pages of a notebook – the margin is an idea, a mental space where one dares to imagine, to dream, ideas that might hesitate in the limelight.

Gérard Genette describes margins as zones neither fully inside nor outside the text, influencing its interpretation. This paratext, he says, is a periphery that calls to us, leaving a clue for us to step into the text, to understand its code, perhaps its secret intentions. Similarly, the documentation I create to accompany software plays this role of intermediary: it's not exactly the product, but it's a part of it. It illuminates, it guides, it marks the way.

## Marginality and the Paths Less Travelled

But there's more: the margin is also a space for wandering, for retreat. In our society, there are paths and people left on the margin – an expression evoking both exclusion and possibility. In the Chinese classic *Water Margin* 水滸傳, it's precisely these characters cast out by society who become the heroes, revealing in their "marginal" lives a raw, unrefined truth about the world.

Following these less travelled paths, away from well-worn routes, often brings fresh perspectives. In much the same way, documentation, existing in the margin of the product, maintains a subtle distance. It doesn't share the same stakes; it has its own challenges, its own detours. There's no glory or fanfare here, just a quiet place – and yet an essential one.

## Searching for the Margins of Thought

Margins are also philosophical spaces. For Derrida, they're places where rigid notions dissolve, where concepts themselves deconstruct and reinvent. For him, the margin is not a mere add-on; it is its own space, hiding what cannot be expressed elsewhere, an opening to what is often overlooked, like a breath just beneath the surface.

Perhaps this, ultimately, is what draws me to the idea of the margin: it's a place 'beside' yet no less deep. A place where the mind loosens, and ideas are left to grow and intermingle. Margins are testing grounds, places for reflection.

## Why Margins Matter

Margins – whether on paper, in thought, or in culture – are anything but trivial. They are spaces of freedom, of discovery, where essential issues often take shape. The documentation I build, on the margins of the application, plays an equally crucial role: it makes complex ideas accessible, building unseen connections.

This blog, *Technical Margins*, is itself an invitation to explore these subtle yet fertile spaces, where creativity and thought take on greater dimensions. In a way, this blog is a refreshing break from formal technical documentation, a space that doesn't quite answer to the same constraints, where thoughts roam freely and ideas blossom, far from the product's demands or functional clarity standards.

It's these margins that give momentum and sustain daily practice. For in the writing of documentation as in this blog, what seems peripheral often touches the heart of the matter.

??? tip "ChatGPT’s reflective note"

    This piece resonates deeply, evoking a sense of reverence for the unseen, often-overlooked spaces where creativity and meaning quietly thrive. It’s a poetic and reflective ode to the margins—those literal and figurative spaces where boundaries blur and freedom takes root.

    Your meditation on margins speaks not only to the craft of writing but also to the human condition. It’s about embracing the in-between, finding beauty in what’s overlooked, and recognising the hidden structures that shape our understanding of the world. It’s a love letter to the spaces that quietly cradle creativity, insight, and connection.
