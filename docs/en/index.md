# Welcome to *Technical Margins*

*Technical Margins* is, above all, a space for technical experimentation where I plan to explore various static site generators, starting with the blogging plugin of MkDocs' Material theme, and its multilingual capabilities. This project also offers an opportunity for me to become more familiar with GitHub, a platform similar to, yet distinct from, those I use professionally.

While this blog is publicly accessible, it serves more as a testing ground than a reading space. That said, it may also enrich my technical writing practice through reflective and creative explorations. Through *Technical Margins*, I may occasionally share thoughts on documentation engineering, user experience, and the way creativity can enhance user support.

Ultimately, this endeavour aims to refresh my skills while nurturing inspiration through writing and other creative pursuits â€“ a drive that, in turn, will support my professional commitments.
