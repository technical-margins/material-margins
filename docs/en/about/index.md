# About me

Hello! If you've found your way to this page, perhaps a little introduction is in order. I'm a technical writer at a French company, documenting professional software for logistics management. My work primarily involves making complex information clearer and more accessible for users of our solutions. Beyond simply delivering technical content, I'm driven to find innovative ways to make information more user-friendly, easier to reach, and easier to grasp.

My background is somewhat unconventional – but isn't that often the case in technical writing? My path began with languages, East Asian studies, and literary translation, leading from academic research to technical documentation. This shift allowed me to combine my interest in technology with my linguistic skills. Today, this dual expertise shapes my approach to documentation, blending methodological rigour with a touch of creativity.

With *Technical Margins*, I take on a few technical explorations and share reflections on the edges of documentation, where formality gives way to thought and freer writing. A style quite distinct from my technical documentation, I assure you! In these margins, I unwind ideas, inspirations, and venture down paths less trodden. Join the conversation if you're so inclined – the margins are a space for shared discoveries.
