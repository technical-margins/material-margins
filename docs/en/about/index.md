# About

### Hello from the Margins

If you've found your way to this page, perhaps a little introduction is in order. I'm a technical writer at a French software company, translating complex business solutions into human-readable language. My daily mission? To transform intricate technical landscapes into clear, navigable maps for users.

### The Unconventional Path

My background? A bit of an oddity. I started with languages, wandered through East Asian studies, and somehow landed in technical documentation. Not a traditional route, but then again, who follows traditional routes these days?

### What This is About

This blog isn't going to revolutionise the world of documentation. It's just a breathing space where formal technical writing exhales and something more personal inhales. Here, I'll unpack thoughts that don't fit neatly into user manuals.

With *Technical Margins*, I'll take on some technical explorations and share reflections on the edges of documentation, where formality gives way to thought and freer writing. A style quite distinct from my technical communication, I assure you!

### The Invitation

Consider this an open invitation. Join the conversation if you're so inclined – the margins are a space for shared discoveries. They're a place for exploration, for conversations that meander between the structured and the spontaneous. If you're intrigued by the spaces where technical precision meets human narrative, you're welcome here.

    These musings are mine alone – not a corporate manifesto, corporate communication, or anything remotely official. My employer bears no responsibility for the occasional wandering thoughts that escape these margins.
