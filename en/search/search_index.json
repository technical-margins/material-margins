If you've found your way to this page, perhaps a little introduction is in order. I'm a technical writer at a French company, documenting professional software for logistics management. My work primarily involves making complex information clearer and more accessible for users of our solutions. Beyond simply delivering technical content, I'm driven to find innovative ways to make information more user-friendly, easier to reach, and easier to grasp.</p> <p>My background is somewhat unconventional \u2013 but isn't that often the case in technical writing? My path began with languages, East Asian studies, and literary translation, leading from academic research to technical documentation. This shift allowed me to combine my interest in technology with my linguistic skills. Today, this dual expertise shapes my approach to documentation, blending methodological rigour with a touch of creativity.</p> <p>With Technical Margins, I take on a few technical explorations and share reflections on the edges of documentation, where formality gives way to thought and freer writing. A style quite distinct from my technical documentation, I assure you! In these margins, I unwind ideas, inspirations, and venture down paths less trodden. Join the conversation if you're so inclined \u2013 the margins are a space for shared discoveries.</p> <p>Disclaimer</p> <p>This blog has no affiliation with my company.

Though recognised as indispensable, it is often relegated to the background in practice. \"We'll document it later\", \"The priority is delivering the product\" \u2013 these are phrases every technical writer knows well, like a well-worn refrain.</p> <p>Yet, there are other inspiring models. In the aerospace industry, each aircraft comes with thousands of pages of detailed documentation that doesn't just explain \u2013 but ensures safety and efficiency.</p> <p>But transposing this model to software development remains a challenge, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises. Although resources are often limited, commitment and rigour can make this work possible. It requires shifting the view of documentation as a \"secondary\" task, often left to developers or project managers, as though writing were just an add-on or an optional \"extra\". In many ways, this is like asking a pilot to write their own aircraft manual between flights \u2013 a situation that underscores the critical need for dedicated technical writing professionals.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/10/29/user-documentation-making-the-invisible-visible/#from-complexity-to-clarity-my-role-as-a-translator","title":"From Complexity to Clarity: My Role as a Translator","text":"<p>In this context, technical writing truly comes into its own. As a writer, my role isn't just to capture information; it's to transform it. Like a translator working not between languages A and B, but between technical and human languages. It's about unveiling the invisible, bringing to light what might remain a mystery, making the impenetrable suddenly accessible to the end user. A task that is not done in isolation.</p> <p>At the heart of my mission is collaboration with development teams. Together, we explore the product and its innovations. These exchanges aren't just about passing on information; they're lively dialogues where we dissect each feature and illuminate complexities.

When well done, it frees up support teams by addressing simple queries, and it allows them to focus on more complex cases. It gives the user autonomy, a space where they can explore advanced features at their own pace and uncover the full richness of the product.</p> <p>For novices, it's a launch ramp, a discreet guide that takes them by the hand, whispering simple instructions, dispelling their initial doubts to lead them towards mastery. And in critical environments, where every detail counts, it acts as a silent guardrail, a shield against errors and missteps.</p> <p>Customer feedback consistently demonstrates this impact: when contextual help, step-by-step guides, and concrete examples are integrated into the interface, adoption rates increase. Well-crafted documentation serves as a strategic compass, guiding users toward greater autonomy, confidence, and mastery of the product.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/10/29/user-documentation-making-the-invisible-visible/#making-the-invisible-visible","title":"Making the Invisible Visible","text":"<p>Recognition for technical writers is rare, but deeply rewarding.

Play us something?\" How many times have I heard these words, laden with expectations?

In French, \"performance\" resonates with reaching a high standard, whereas in English, it gravitates towards the stage and the show.

It's no longer work, but an intimate encounter with the instrument, each note alive in the present.</p> <p>Similarly, reading tabs can become an exploration without expectation.

Why not, one might say. This title felt natural. It's there, in the margin, that life slips in. When I think back to my school years, even through university, I see my notebooks, my loose sheets, marked with small sketches, scrawled along the edges, just outside the main content. Far from empty, these margins were lively spaces, uncultivated patches where ideas roamed freely, thoughts that spilled out, uninvited, from the official structure of lessons. For me, doodling in the margins was a way of listening, of musing \u2013 a way to let my thoughts wander and explore.</p> <p>This connection between the margin and creative freedom follows me now in my work as a technical writer. Documentation, a bit like those sketches of yore, often lives in the margin of the product. It's there when needed, off centre stage, sitting quietly in the background, ready to enrich the user experience. And although labelled as \"technical\", it retains within it a small margin of freedom, a secret corner where, despite everything, a hint of creativity sneaks in.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/11/01/margin/#the-margin-as-a-creative-space-beyond-boundaries","title":"The Margin as a Creative Space: Beyond Boundaries","text":"<p>But why this fondness for the margins, this attraction to what lies neither here nor there? Perhaps it's because, in the margin, one can sidestep the constraints of the central framework. What slips into these spaces is less formal, more free. And this isn't limited to the pages of a notebook \u2013 the margin is an idea, a mental space where one dares to imagine, to dream, ideas that might hesitate in the limelight.</p> <p>G\u00e9rard Genette describes margins as zones neither fully inside nor outside the text, influencing its interpretation. This paratext, he says, is a periphery that calls to us, leaving a clue for us to step into the text, to understand its code, perhaps its secret intentions. Similarly, the documentation I create to accompany software plays this role of intermediary: it's not exactly the product, but it's a part of it. It illuminates, it guides, it marks the way.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/11/01/margin/#marginality-and-the-paths-less-travelled","title":"Marginality and the Paths Less Travelled","text":"<p>But there's more: the margin is also a space for wandering, for retreat. In our society, there are paths and people left on the margin \u2013 an expression evoking both exclusion and possibility.

In much the same way, documentation, existing in the margin of the product, maintains a subtle distance. It doesn't share the same stakes; it has its own challenges, its own detours.
