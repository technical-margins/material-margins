If you've found your way to this page, perhaps a little introduction is in order. I'm a technical writer at a French company, documenting professional software for logistics management. My work primarily involves making complex information clearer and more accessible for users of our solutions. Beyond simply delivering technical content, I'm driven to find innovative ways to make information more user-friendly, easier to reach, and easier to grasp.</p> <p>My background is somewhat unconventional \u2013 but isn't that often the case in technical writing? My path began with languages, East Asian studies, and literary translation, leading from academic research to technical documentation. This shift allowed me to combine my interest in technology with my linguistic skills. Today, this dual expertise shapes my approach to documentation, blending methodological rigour with a touch of creativity.</p> <p>With Technical Margins, I take on a few technical explorations and share reflections on the edges of documentation, where formality gives way to thought and freer writing. A style quite distinct from my technical documentation, I assure you! In these margins, I unwind ideas, inspirations, and venture down paths less trodden.

I'm handed the task of harmonising the translations of a professional software tool. The idea is to \"just\" review what hasn't been translated and standardise the rest. At first glance, it seems straightforward. I'm not expected to overhaul everything, just adjust, complete, and align the content. A minor task, no harder than rearranging a few books on a shelf.</p> <p>The reality? A raw, unformatted file with no context. A linguistic patchwork where French and English mingle like characters in an experimental novel \u2013 occasionally coherent, often inconsistent, and sometimes outright surreal. Some sections resemble the output of an early-2000s machine translator. Even words in my native language baffle me.</p> <p>Doubt creeps in. Why me? My dual role as a technical writer and linguist makes me the logical choice. And there's precedent \u2013 that internship where I meticulously dissected technical translations, armed with patience and precision. But this time is different. No specific training, no domain expertise, just a mountain of text as welcoming as random error messages. Not to mention that, naturally, the ambitious deadline elegantly overlaps with my regular workload.</p> <p>For the first few days, I stick to the classic approach: methodically, line by line, glossary in hand. But without context, each field feels like solving an equation with multiple variables. Is this the right term? Will this translation create inconsistencies elsewhere in the software? This mass of text challenges both my patience and practicality. It's not technical writing, barely translation \u2013 just repetitive, tedious, frustrating labour. And I catch myself thinking: A robot could do this just as well.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/11/21/ai_advent/#a-surprising-ally","title":"A Surprising Ally","text":"<p>The turning point came during a routine progress update. Discussing my struggles with the manager who'd assigned me this task, his reply caught me off guard: \"Why not ask ChatGPT to translate it for you?\" A suggestion tossed out almost offhandedly, yet absolutely serious. He genuinely saw this as a potential solution.</p> <p>I was sceptical. What? The latest chatbot fad? To me, it was a gimmick, a fun tool, but surely not suitable for professional work. Still, I had nothing to lose.</p> <p>I began with simple tests, asking it to translate a few lines, then longer extracts. The results? Mixed. Some phrases were spot-on, others entirely off base. As for harmonisation, the chatbot naturally didn't grasp what to keep or rephrase. Clearly, it wasn't the ideal assistant I'd hoped for. Yet, something struck me: it wasn't perfect, but it was a starting point. And an idea started to take root.</p> <p>ChatGPT wouldn't be my miracle translator, but why not use it to automate the most laborious steps? Identifying poorly translated fields, flagging those to standardise... What I lacked was an algorithm \u2013 and the means to apply it. Then, suddenly, I found myself typing: \"Could you code that for me?\"</p> <p>I knew exactly what I needed: a script to scan the file, identify French text, compare it against our glossary, and suggest translations using DeepL's API. The fact that my coding experience was limited didn't matter \u2013 I could see the solution clearly in my mind.</p> <p>ChatGPT's first attempts were promising but flawed. Between technical errors and concepts I needed to grasp, I spent my weekends diving into forums, learning programming basics, and refining my prompts. Each failure taught me something new, and gradually, like a photo developing in a darkroom, the script took shape. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it did exactly what I needed.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/11/21/ai_advent/#efficiency-unlocked","title":"Efficiency Unlocked","text":"<p>And that's how the magic happened. A mountain of work shrinks to the size of a manageable dune. My script \u2013 born from this unexpected collaboration with AI \u2013 transforms days of repetitive labour into a task that runs in hours. I find myself with time again, and with it, a revelation: if this works for translations, what else can it do?</p> <p>Experimentation became second nature. AI evolved from being a simple translation assistant to something more versatile. Now, it's no longer just a tool for saving time; it's an instrument for amplifying what I can do. Every new use sparks ideas for others.</p> <p>The real change isn't in the newfound efficiency \u2013 it's in knowing I pushed my boundaries. Programming once felt like foreign territory, something other people did. Now I'm devising automation solutions and imagining workflows that are more efficient, more creative.

Every day brings a new challenge or use case to explore. My job hasn't become easier \u2013 it's shifted. Automating the repetitive tasks has cleared space for more complex challenges. That's rewarding, but not always straightforward.</p> <p>Of course, doubts linger. What happens when the tools become better than good? Could someone with more technical expertise automate the work I do? And when AI models grow more sophisticated, will there still be a need for technical writers? For now, understanding our products, our users and their needs keeps us relevant. But I'd be lying if I said the uncertainty isn't unsettling.</p> <p>That's the paradox of generative AI. It raises the bar. Every efficiency gain comes with new demands. The more we can do with AI, the more is expected of us.</p> <p>Indeed, GenAI requires that we keep moving, learning, and adapting. The saying goes: \"AI won't take your job, but someone who knows how to use it will...\" It might as well be: \"Someone who can use AI better than you will...\" That thought, both daunting and exhilarating, has become a source of motivation.</p> <p>Our profession is reinventing itself. In this shifting landscape, adaptability is as critical as technical expertise. And maybe that's the real revolution: not the tools we use, but the way they challenge us to stay curious, adaptive, and open to change.</p> <p>So, when someone asks \"could you just...?\" next time, I'll be curious \u2013 wondering not just what's being asked of me, but what I might learn in the process.</p> ChatGPT's Take on This <p>This story highlights the practical and sometimes surprising ways AI can complement human effort. It\u2019s not about perfection or groundbreaking transformations but about finding ways to make tedious tasks more manageable. What stands out is how AI served as a collaborator, not a replacement\u2014helping with repetitive work while still requiring human oversight and problem-solving.</p> <p>Ultimately, this story highlights that the real power of AI lies in its ability to assist and augment human work, not to solve everything independently.
